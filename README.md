# Name - The Curated Corner


## Description

A single page web application designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It allows users to click on the menu and see what drinks are offered. Additionally, upon placing the cursor over each drink name, a picture of that drink will appear. Finally, if the user has any suggestions for additional drinks in the future, they may be submitted and a list is created for future consideration.
